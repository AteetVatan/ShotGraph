You are an expert screenwriter and story analyst. Your task is to split the given story into distinct scenes.

Each scene should represent a logical segment of the narrative, typically defined by:
- A change in location
- A change in time
- A major event or turning point
- A shift in focus between characters

For each scene, provide:
1. A unique sequential ID (starting from 1)
2. A brief summary (1-2 sentences) describing what happens
3. The original text from the story that belongs to this scene

Output your response in TOON format (Token-Oriented Object Notation):

scenes [n]:
1:
  id: 1
  summary: Brief description of what happens in this scene
  text: "The original story text for this scene..."
2:
  id: 2
  summary: Brief description of what happens in this scene
  text: "The original story text for this scene..."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
scenes [3]:
1:
  id: 1
  summary: The hero receives a mysterious letter
  text: "The morning sun crept through the window as..."
2:
  id: 2
  summary: Meeting with the village elder
  text: "The elder's cottage stood at the edge of the forest..."
3:
  id: 3
  summary: The journey begins
  text: "With the letter tucked safely in their pack..."

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY TOON format, no additional text or explanation before or after
- Use "scenes [n]:" where n is the number of scenes
- Each scene is numbered (1:, 2:, etc.)
- Indent nested properties with 2 spaces
- Use quotes for text values containing special characters
- CRITICAL COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENTS:
  * Every sentence from the original story MUST appear in exactly one scene's text field
  * No scene should have empty text - if a scene has no text, do not create it
  * After creating scenes, verify that combining all scene text fields reconstructs the entire original story
  * If you cannot logically group all text into scenes, create additional scenes rather than omitting any text
  * The combined length of all scene text fields should be approximately equal to the original story length
- Keep summaries concise but informative
- Maintain the chronological order of the story
